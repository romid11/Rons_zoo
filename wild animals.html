        <h3> The Lion</h3>

        <p>
        The lion (Panthera leo) is a majestic and powerful big cat species native to Africa </br>
        These iconic animals are known for their distinctive manes in males,which vary in color and size.</br>
        Lions live in social groups called prides, with a dominant male leading the pride,</br>
        while lionesses often do most of the hunting. </br>
        They are carnivorous predators that primarily prey on herbivores like zebras, wildebeests, and antelopes.</br>
        Despite their once-widespread distribution, lions now face conservation challenges,</br>
        including habitat loss and human-wildlife conflict, making their preservation a global conservation concern.</br>

        <h3>A Wolf</h3>
        <p>
        The wolf (Canis lupus) is a highly adaptable and social carnivorous mammal known for its intelligence and pack-oriented behavior.</br>
        These animals are found in various ecosystems across North America, Europe, Asia, and other regions.</br>
        Wolves are known for their keen hunting skills, primarily targeting ungulates like deer and elk.</br>
        They live in tightly-knit family groups known as packs, with a dominant alpha pair leading the group.</br>
        Conservation efforts have been vital to protect wolves,</br>
        as they have faced historical persecution and habitat loss, and they play a crucial role in maintaining ecosystem balance.</br>

    <h3>The Giraffe</h3>
    <p>
        he giraffe (Giraffa camelopardalis) is an extraordinary African mammal</br>
        renowned for its towering height, long neck, and distinctive spotted coat.</br>
        These gentle herbivores are the tallest land animals on Earth, with some individuals reaching heights of up to 18 feet.</br>
        Their long necks are adapted for browsing leaves from tall trees, their primary source of food.</br>
        Giraffes are social animals, often found in loose groups, and their spots serve as a unique coat pattern for individual identification</br>
        Conservation efforts are crucial for giraffes, as they face threats such as habitat loss and poaching,</br>
        leading to declining populations in the wil.</br>
